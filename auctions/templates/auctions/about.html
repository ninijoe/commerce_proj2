            <li> <h4>AuctionBoxx (founded in Canada) is an online social market site where users can auction/sell as well as
               advertise anything ranging from electronics, movies, songs, books etc and engage with sellers as well as buyers of products and services.
               Through carefully curated listings, and a safe center for buyer/seller interactions, we aim to enhance the advent of trade through social technology whether you are a collector, business, merchant or just looking to get rid of your old ps4 controller.
               <br>
               AuctionBoxx is the best site to advertise goods for sale, auction of antiques, drive traffic to other online sites, curate a portfolio for sales
               and generate revenue through leads as well as customer purchases and interaction.
               <br>
               AuctionBoxx being a local company employs local residents of the Nanaimo region, as a means to generate revenue for the city as well as promote the
               importance of growing local businesses in Canada. AuctionBoxx is free.
            </li> <br>
            <li> <h4>OUR GENESIS: AuctionBoxx is a product created by a computer science major at the Vancouver Island University. It began
              as a <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/">Harvard CS50 assignment</a> and transitioned into an avenue
              for students to look up, buy and sell textbooks at school as it proved difficult to find the right sources online for things one may desire locally.
              The site is designed to favour local trade and barter, so users can reach sellers and customers within their cities and geopolitical locations easily.
              <br>
              We are happy to serve the local populace of Nanaimo and look forward to growing to other cities and provinces around Canada and soon, globally.
              The students are residents here in Nanaimo and works hard everyday to provide the best service to all users.
